These projects introduce the fundamental concepts, theory and algorithmic ideas of machine learning. It provides a basis for applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems or for researching the development of new machine learning algorithms and methods. More precisely, the projects focus
on the main techniques of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement machine learning. The following points will be developed:
• clustering: algorithms based on centroids, density and distribution, agglomerative hierarchical clustering,
Expectation maximization for soft clustering.
• Linear regression: simple and multiple regression analyses,
least squares method, maximum likelihood estimation.
• Discriminative and generative classifiers: logistic regression, naive Bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests.
• performance metrics, hyperparameter tuning and
performance estimation protocols: ROC and AUC curves,
cross validation, nested cross validation, bootstrapping,
overfitting and model selection.
• Feature selection: forward-backward search, lasso,
orthogonal matching search.
• Markovian decision process and dynamic programming
: Bellman equations, iteration on policy, iteration on
value.
• Monte Carlo methods: prediction and control variable.
• Temporal difference learning: Q learning, deep Q learning.
