# Data Science Project

## Description

These projects introduce the fundamental concepts, theory and
algorithmic ideas of machine learning. It provides a basis for applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems or for researching the development of new machine learning algorithms and methods. More precisely, the projects focus
on the main techniques of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement machine learning.
The following points will be developed:
* clustering: algorithms based on centroids, density and distribution, agglomerative hierarchical clustering,
* Expectation maximization for soft clustering.
* Linear regression: simple and multiple regression analyses, least squares method, maximum likelihood estimation.
* Discriminative and generative classifiers: logistic regression, naive Bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests.
* Performance metrics, hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation protocols: ROC and AUC curves, cross validation, nested cross validation, bootstrapping, overfitting and model selection.
* Feature selection: forward-backward search, lasso, orthogonal matching search.
* Markovian decision process and dynamic programming: Bellman equations, iteration on policy, iteration on value.
* Monte Carlo methods: prediction and control variable.
* Temporal difference learning: Q learning, deep Q learning.

Computer vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in image search, mapping, medicine, drones, self-driving cars, and so on. Visual recognition tasks such as classification, localization and image detection are at the heart of these applications. Recent developments in approaches to
deep neural network (deep learning) have greatly advanced the performance of these visual recognition systems.

The following themes will be covered during these projects:

* Learning algorithms (backpropagation, dropout, batch standardization, transfer learning, etc.)
* Deep learning architectures for visual recognition tasks: Convolution Networks (ConvNet: AlexNet, ResNet, VGG,…), Recurrent Networks (RNN), Generative Models (PixelCNN, Generative Adversarial Networks - GAN,…), Deep Compression,…
* Case studies borrowed from research, classification images, image generation, object detection, changing the image style (DeepDream), semantic segmentation, etc. will illustrate these themes.
